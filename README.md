## Description
The goal of this project is to create a template or "skeleton" for a MERN stack backend. The overall functionality will cover user account CRUD operations, basic user lists, and authentication. The idea is to have this handy for any MERN stack project I might have in the future.

## Installation
To install all node modules you can run "node install" or simply right-click on "package.json" and install dependencies. 
## Usage
You can use this repo as a reference for building a MERN stack backend for things like e-shops, auction sites, and whatever else  requires user account CRUD operations. To run the development side, uncomment the two functions in the DevBundle.js file and run "yarn development" or whatever other package manager you're using, then run "yarn build" to compile the server side code and finally run "yarn start" once you're ready to run in production. This code will give you the basic backend for any potential MERN stack application that you might want to  create.

## Contributing
To contribute to this repo, you can add middleware functionality or front-end components to test out the stack, any contribution should have comments explaining the changes or modifications, but besides that go at it! 
## Tests 
You can simply run this using "npm run start" or "yarn start" and change the code in the client side to verify changes are instantly updating.
